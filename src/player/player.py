Player Analysis for BPL 10

Author: Cearlmau

This file breaks down the player distribution of BPL teams based on team and level
at various points in the BPL 10 event. The goal of this data analysis is to look at
whether or not the team distributions had an effect on overall team player levels, and
how that may contribute to a team's success.

Special thanks to Moowiz for providing the data.
